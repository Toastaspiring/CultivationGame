## Installation Instructions

### For Roblox Studio:

1. **Create New Place**:
   - Open Roblox Studio

2. **Import Server Scripts**:
   - Copy all files from `ServerScriptService/` to your ServerScriptService
   - Ensure all scripts are properly nested as shown in the structure

3. **Import Shared Modules**:
   - Copy the `Shared/` folder to ReplicatedStorage
   - Verify that GameConstants.lua and RemoteEvents.lua are accessible

4. **Import Client Scripts**:
   - Copy all files from `StarterPlayerScripts/` to StarterPlayerScripts
   - Maintain the folder structure for UI, Combat, Cultivation, and Resources

5. **Configure DataStores**:
   - Enable Studio Access to API Services in Game Settings
   - Configure DataStore names in the scripts if needed

6. **Set Up Remote Events**:
   - The RemoteEvents module will automatically create necessary RemoteEvents
   - Verify they appear in ReplicatedStorage when the game runs

### Configuration:

1. **Game Constants**:
   - Edit `GameConstants.lua` to adjust game balance
   - Modify realm requirements, resource costs, and progression rates

2. **World Setup**:
   - Use the WorldDescriptions.md as reference for creating game areas
   - Place resource nodes, sect territories, and training areas

3. **Testing**:
   - Start with 2+ players to test multiplayer features
   - Test sect creation, combat, and resource systems

### Player Data Structure
```lua
playerData = {
    -- Basic Info
    userId = player.UserId,
    username = player.Name,
    joinDate = tick(),
    
    -- Progression
    cultivationRealm = 1,
    martialRealm = 1,
    bloodline = "Common",
    heartAffinity = math.random(1, 100),
    
    -- Cultivation Data
    cultivation = {
        currentQi = 100,
        maxQi = 1000,
        techniques = {},
        breakthroughProgress = 0,
        -- ... more fields
    },

    },
    
    -- Sect Information
    sect = {
        sectId = nil,
        rank = 0,
        contributionPoints = 0,
        joinDate = nil,
        permissions = {}
    },
    
    -- Combat Stats
    combat = {
        health = 1000,
        maxHealth = 1000,
        wins = 0,
        losses = 0,
        combatRating = 100
    },
    
    -- Statistics
    stats = {
        totalPlayTime = 0,
        resourcesGathered = 0,
        pillsRefined = 0,
        battlesWon = 0
    }
}
```

### Realm Progression
- **Cultivation Realms**: 12 major realms from Qi Refining to Immortal Ascension
- **Martial Realms**: 10 major realms from Third Rate to Martial God
- **Breakthrough Requirements**: Resources, time, and sometimes special conditions
- **Bottlenecks**: Challenging transitions that may require assistance or special items

### Combat Mechanics
- **Turn-Based System**: Strategic combat with action selection
- **Intent Reading**: Martial artists can predict opponent actions
- **Emotion Effects**: Different emotions provide various combat bonuses
- **Spiritual Techniques**: Cultivation-based attacks and defenses
- **Gang Qi**: Advanced martial energy manipulation

### Resource Economy
- **Scarcity Model**: Limited resource nodes create competition
- **Quality System**: Resources have different quality levels affecting outcomes
- **Crafting Chains**: Complex recipes requiring multiple resource types
- **Market Dynamics**: Player-driven economy with supply and demand

## Customization Options

### Balancing:
- Adjust realm progression requirements in GameConstants.lua
- Modify resource spawn rates and quantities
- Change combat damage values and success rates
- Alter sect creation costs and benefits

### Content Expansion:
- Add new cultivation techniques and martial arts forms
- Create additional resource types and crafting recipes
- Design new sect types with unique abilities
- Implement seasonal events and special challenges

### Visual Enhancements:
- Add particle effects for cultivation and martial arts
- Create custom UI themes for different sects
- Implement environmental effects for different regions
- Add visual indicators for player realm and emotion state

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations:
- Player data is cached on client to reduce server calls
- Resource nodes use efficient respawn timers
- Combat calculations are optimized for multiple simultaneous battles
- Sect data is loaded on-demand to reduce memory usage

### Security Features:
- All critical calculations performed on server
- Input validation for all client requests
- Anti-cheat measures for resource gathering and combat
- Secure data storage with backup systems

### Scalability:
- Modular system design allows easy feature addition
- Database structure supports large player populations
- Efficient networking minimizes bandwidth usage
- Load balancing considerations for high-traffic scenarios

## Support and Development

### Common Issues:
1. **DataStore Errors**: Ensure API services are enabled in Studio
2. **Remote Event Failures**: Check that all modules are properly required
3. **UI Not Loading**: Verify client scripts are in correct locations
4. **Combat Desync**: Ensure both players have stable connections

### Development Roadmap:
- [ ] Advanced formation array system
- [ ] Beast taming and spirit contracts
- [ ] Cross-server sect wars
- [ ] Seasonal events and festivals
- [ ] Mobile UI optimization
- [ ] Advanced analytics and metrics

### Contributing:
This project is designed to be modular and extensible. When adding new features:
1. Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions
2. Add appropriate error handling and validation
3. Update documentation for new systems
4. Test thoroughly with multiple players
5. Consider performance impact of new features
